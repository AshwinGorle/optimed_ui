By developing these drugs, IBT addresses medical needs that lack available treatments.",

      "COMPANY_DESCRIPTION": "We created Lansing Urgent Care from a desire to offer you a refreshing solution to an often inefficient, overpriced and stressful healthcare system. Though your primary care physician is always your best first contact for your health needs, primary physicians are often overburdened which leads to appointment delays at the moment you need care. The emergency room is an over utilized, expensive and stressful place to seek healthcare when you don't have a true emergency. In fact, the cost of care received at the ER is approximately 700% higher than similar care received at an urgent care! We offer a solution.\n\nOur philosophy:\nSee you at your convenience \nProvide top level care without top level pricing \nBe ever mindful that your time is valuable \nCreate a warm and relaxed environment \nInclude you in the medical decision process \nTreat you as we would treat our own \n\nLansing Urgent Care promises you premier care in an unrivaled urgent care setting. Enjoy free Wi-Fi. Your favorite shows are a click away as each room is equipped with a flat screen cable television. Many medications are available right on site for your convenience to eliminate the need to spend additional time at the pharmacy. We have digital X-ray and rapid lab testing on site, and our average door to door times are under an hour (compared with 3-4 hours at an emergency center).\n\nExperience healthcare where we never forget that we're here to serve you.\n\nIt's our pleasure to care for you.",

The founders saw a tremendous need among underserved school aged children who did not have easy access to dental care and who often suffered from poor oral hygiene, tooth decay, pain and associated health problems. \n\nKnowing that many parents could not take their children to the dentist due to issues including time off from work and transportation challenges, they sought to bring the care to the need.\n \nUsing the latest technology in portable equipment, a team of dedicated dental professionals provide preventive and restorative dental care to children right at school.  Our flexibility and expertise allow us to transform classrooms, auditoriums, gyms or other suitable areas into fully functional dental offices for the day.\n\nEvery year, through its devoted group of dental professionals, Smile Programs\u2026the mobile dentists puts happy, healthy smiles on over 500,000 children from coast to coast.\n\nJoin us in our mission to bring smiles and good oral health to where they are needed.

      "COMPANY_DESCRIPTION": "Emergent Health Partners is a nonprofit emergency medical services organization providing ALS and BLS EMS services to 1.1 million people in 14 counties of southern Michigan. Emergent Health operates out of Ann Arbor, Michigan with additional regional headquarters in Plymouth, Jackson, Battle Creek, and Monroe. The organization is governed by a volunteer Board of Trustees made up of community leaders from our service area.\n\nEmergent Health's flagship EMS agency, Huron Valley Ambulance, was founded in 1981. Since its Ann Arbor-based beginnings, HVA has expanded to serve all of Washtenaw County as well as portions of Wayne and Oakland counties. After HVA's success, it continued to grow by creating four additional ambulance services to provide emergency care throughout Jackson, Monroe, Lenawee, and Calhoun counties. \n\nIn 2012, Emergent Health Partners was founded in an effort to bring all five ambulance services together as a strong, cohesive EMS operation. In 2018, Emergent Health expanded to Michigan's west side when LifeCare Ambulance of Battle Creek was added to the organization. This new growth made Emergent Health Partners the largest EMS provider in Michigan. \n\nEmergent Health Partners operates with over 100 ambulances and close to 600 licensed EMTs and paramedics. All of Emergent Health's EMS operations are accredited by CAAS - the Commission on Accreditation of Ambulance Services. Of the 13,000 ambulance services currently operating in the United States, fewer than 200 are presently CAAS accredited. Maintaining CAAS accreditation assures that Emergent Health Partners prioritizes up-to-date and well-maintained equipment, rigorous employee training, and high-level hiring requirements in order to provide the communities we serve with exemplary pre-hospital emergency care.",

      "COMPANY_DESCRIPTION": "In 2014, an ER department physician shared his frustration with the inability of traditional vital signs to detect and predict patient destabilization that can lead to crisis. That challenged our team of nurses, physicians, and scientists to put the power of advanced signal processing and clinician supervised machine learning to work to break the code of the autonomic nervous system.\n\nThe result was the AHI System \u2013 the only FDA-cleared clinical decision support device of its kind, predicting episodes of hemodynamic instability with clinically significant lead times, and giving care teams the time to plan and intervene to avoid a costly crisis, improve patient throughput and increase the overall effectiveness of telemetry monitoring.\n\nAHI, or Analytic for Hemodynamic Instability, was developed using artificial intelligence to see Heart Rate Variability (HRV), part of the autonomic nervous system (ANS).  Fifth Eye discovered how to measure and interpret HRV data flow and ECG morphology features, predicting the hemodynamic risk that leads to acute decline in clinical status. Traditional vitals like blood pressure and pulse rate are \"lagging indicators\", unable to see hours or days into the future to identify patients who may be at risk from compromised compensatory systems.\n\nAHI works on a single, noninvasive ECG lead II, displaying patient status updates every two minutes from anywhere in the hospital. There are no manual inputs, no new hardware and AHI is easy to adopt and use immediately. \n\nAHI is making a difference in the lives of patients and clinical teams \u2013 getting ahead of vitals to help patients on the brink of crisis receive care sooner and enhancing throughput to downgrade or discharge stable patients sooner.\n\nTo learn more, visit FIFTHeye.com\n\nThe AHI System is intended for use by healthcare professionals managing patients 18 years or older who are receiving continuous physiological monitoring with electrocardiography (ECG) in hospitals.",
